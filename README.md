### Movie Search Engine

Hello! Welcome to my movie search engine...

#### Getting started

- Download the data set *title.basics.tsv.gz* from [here](https://datasets.imdbws.com/)
- Unzip the .gz file and and add the tsv- file to the movie-search-engine folder (the one with the docker compose file)
- Run *docker compose up*
- **Note** that running for the first time the creation of the database might take some time. The movie-data volume should be at 3.4 GB when finished loading.
